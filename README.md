## History and other notes

This mod requires [MixinBooter](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter).

interfaces to transfer items to players in the Vethea dimension.

The mod is [open-source](https://github.com/shardion/restrictplayerinterfaces/) and licensed under the MIT license (yes, you can use it in your modpack).
